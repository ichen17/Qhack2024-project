# Qhack_project
In this project, we explore the performance of methodologies for finding the spectral gap of molecules.
* Implementing different variational quantum eigensolver approaches (SS-VQE, VQD, FS VQE, and VQE-X) for $H_2$, $LiH$, and $BeH_2$.
* Adaptive VQE architechture.
* Entanglement forging for scaling up.
* Quantum natural gradient for acceleration to convergence.
